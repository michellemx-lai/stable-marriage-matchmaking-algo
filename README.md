# Gale-Shapley Algorithm for Matching (Many-to-Many)

This project builds upon a basic project, where a program was built to create and store students and high schools to be matched together using principles from the stable marriage problem (SMP). This version of the project also automates some of the more tedious aspects of the previous project, namely, manual student and school data entry and matching. 

# Overview of the Stable Marriage Problem (SMP)
SMP is described as follows. Say you have a group of n men and n women, and they need to be matched together in marriage.The men have ranked all the women in order of preference (1 is most preferred, n is least preferred), and the women have similarly ranked all the men in order of preference. The matching solution should make sure that each man is married to exactly one woman and vice versa, and that the marriages are stable. A stable matching solution means that there is no one person who would rather be with someone else who would also prefer to be with them. In other words, no two people would want to have an affair with each other.

# Main Objectives
In this project, I have achieved three key objectives:

  1. Read student and school data from files
  2. Automate the process of creating and storing objects (i.e. students and school objects)
  3. Use the famous Gale-Shapley algorithm to automate the matching

# User Experience
The user experience is greatly improved as manual inputs are minimized -- school and student data are loaded into the program through Excel files. 

# Learnings
The key learnings from this project includes reading files, and the logic involved in the famous Gale-Shapley matchmaking algorithm.
